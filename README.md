# EEP520_FinalProject
Winter2023 EEP520 Final Project
# Overview
The goal of this project is to simualte the image formation by convex lens, as we know the rays will converge after falling on the convex lens. The parameters are already set as constant, including focal length and the position of light source. The user can move the lens left or right by pressing `A` or `D`, and it will show the relative simulation result. Furthermore, the buttons `Reset` and `Light source is on the focal point` can reposition the lens directly.
